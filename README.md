# Move beyond single channel analysis: the future of analytics is the entire customer journey

## Abstract (1 paragraph)

You've been asked by your VP to demonstrate revenue channels. You go to provide this information, but all the data available to you shows is that your revenue came from your website or your physical store. Nothing insightful because the insight is in the details - the emails, the app engagement, the ad impressions - all information spread throughout different tools. In comes Adobe's Customer Journal Analytics, a tool that empowers you to piece together all these details seamlessly into one coherent picture of the customer. And with that full picture comes the ability to do real data analysis and science. 
Now when your VP asks for that information, you're able to provide a comprehensive look into revenue channels. All without needing to enlist a data engineer or data scientist because your data is integrated and easy to access.

<!--- this sounds like an ad for Adobe. I want to know what you are doing specifically, with what data, and what you will find -->


## Context 

Customer Journal Analytics fills a niche in the software market. While many large companies employ Business Intelligence teams to answer omnichannel questions, the process is time intensive. It's common for requests to be funneled through a ticketing system, which can take days to fulfill while the BI team extracts that data, combines it, and provides a visualization. Best case scenario, the request is properly satisfied and inspires new insightful questions. Worst case, the process begins again because the request was not fulfilled. Without CJA, the entire process takes time, and further, people who are skilled in coding and data analysis.

<!--- remember your audience. Folks don't know what CJA is or what CA are for that matter. Start with the basics -->

With the lag to finding these insights <!---what insights? example?-->, a company will fall behind on meeting the expectations of the customer. If they don't find the friction in the customer journey, they will never know where to focus their resources. They spend on marketing channels, or decrease others not seeing what is driving engagement. It's cost intensive to have a variety of programs for mutliple business units to work from. And truly worst case, some people might work from different sources of data and derive different insights. Consumers make decisions too fast for lag to be an acceptable part of the business process. With the demands on the company and the needs of the customer, companies need to harness all of the data at their disposal immediately.

<!--- maybe give me an example of the specific problem you are trying to solve -->

## Proposal 

Adobe has positioned Customer Journey Analytics to be the tool belt to help everyone at the organization. The focus is usually on the easy to use interface, and the ability to find meaningful insights at the speed of thought. It gets positioned in a way that appeals to marketing teams or teams without the technical skill set to do data wrangling and exploration on their own. But CJA is real data democratization. It is an asset for the non technical, but it additionally provides API integration across various tools, including R. This makes it useful to all business units with a variety of skill-sets - those that can benefit from data exploration in a robust, drag and drop system, to those that want to take the data even further and model behaviors on it. With the added benefit of everyone working from one source of data, now every team will see the same customers, and speak to the same story.

<!--- but what is the question you are trying to answer? Something about how CJA helps data scientists do their work?  -->

I will integrate R with the demo data that Adobe makes available to their Data and Insights team. I will extract it with a R package called CJAR. I will then document the time saved by being able to just work off of pre-cleaned and pre-stitched data. Showcasing how CJA empowers everyone in an organization to explore and analyze the entire customer journey while working from one tool.

<!--- let's work together on the best way to do this -->

I expect to find that it is a time saving experience when modeling from pre-cleaned and pre-stitched data. That insights can be found and data exploration can occur for a data scientist within CJA, but also within R. Additionally, by making meaningful models, and bringing those scores back into CJA, everyone at a company will benefit from the technical expertise of a team member. Once done, we can really highlight the deep power of CJA - that truly, anyone, anywhere can tell the holistic story from one source of data. 

## Conclusion

Knowing that the expectation of a customer is on the brand, and not the channel changes how companies must operate <!--- I don't understand this sentence -->. You cannot truly optimize a single channel until you understand how that channel impacts others and the customer. Data sets need to be combined in order to truly see how this must happen. Data analysis and data science is the crucial building block of companies moving forward, and unless you bring all the data together to see the whole picture, you will fall behind. Customer Journal Analytics answers this question.

It then has the unspoken benefit of everyone working from the same source of data. This is not a replacement of your BI team, it is empowering and expediting your BI team, and further, making it a tool to be harnessed by everyone. You don't have to be technical, or you can be incredibly technical. CJA strengthens every member of the team. 

The value in my execution will come in being able to talk specifically about potential API integration and highlight the value of CJA to companies with specific data science needs. This is currently a part we, on my team, do not frequently discuss with potential customers. Moving beyond this simple proof of concept means we can show to others that this is not a visualization tool. This is a complete answer.

Potential limitations are that I am working from data coming from the demo environment which is largely faked. The downfall will be it might not have enough robustness to execute a model. I have received a preliminary okay to use Adobe's actual data if I cannot do this from within the demo environment. Once I have accomplished this, I will be showing my team at Adobe some additional capabilities we do not feature. Arming them with this knowledge will allow them to speak to their customers, and equip us all to talk about CJA beyond answering the needs of one business unit, but all business units.
